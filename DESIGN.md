Design
======

This document shall show how the game is to be built from different
blocks.

As of 2015-03-09, most details are still to be figured out, and I think
rather than diving right into coding we should design the game we want
prior to writing any code.

Pre-coding
----------

  * The game's name will be 'Box Tanks'
  * The game will be written in Javascript!!!
  * The game will be browser-based
  * The game should be downloadable
 
Possibilities 
-------------
  * There could be server hosted multiplayer
(Though this is all of the list for now this list is possibly the only one that will be added to throughout the project as we are always looking for new ideas for the game!!!)

The Sad News
------------
  * NO 3D (I think)
  * Design probably won't be the work of the century
  * We don't have that many people working on this repository so progress will be slow
  * I (BadgerBoy1002) am a noob at Blender...wait does that even matter?

Classes
-------

This is where we explain how the game will be formed from different
subsystems, which classes will form each subclasses, and the routines
that such classes should have.

  * Interface
    * InterfaceGui
    * InterfaceCli
