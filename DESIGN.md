Design
======

This document shall show how the game is to be built from different
blocks.

As of 2015-03-09, most details are still to be figured out, and I think
rather than diving right into coding we should design the game we want
prior to writing any code.


Pre-coding
----------

  * The game's name will be "Box Tanks" (TODO: make sure that
    this fits whatever we decide on for requirements)
  * The game will be written in Javascript!!!


Classes
-------

This is where we explain how the game will be formed from different
subsystems, which classes will form each subclasses, and the routines
that such classes should have.

  * Interface
    * InterfaceGui
    * InterfaceCli
